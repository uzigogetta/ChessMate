## 🔧 Naming Convention Compliance

### React Native Autolinking Rules ✅
| Requirement | Expected | Actual | Status |
|-------------|----------|--------|--------|
| Package name | `@scope/react-native-*` | `@uzigogetta/react-native-stockfish-jsi` | ✅ |
| Podspec filename | `react-native-stockfish-jsi.podspec` | `react-native-stockfish-jsi.podspec` | ✅ |
| Podspec s.name | `"react-native-stockfish-jsi"` | `"react-native-stockfish-jsi"` | ✅ |
| Config podspecPath | Points to correct file | `ios/react-native-stockfish-jsi.podspec` | ✅ |

**All naming matches!** Autolinking should work! ✅

---

## 📋 Git Status

### Repository State ✅
- **Branch**: main
- **Latest commit**: `23683a9 fix: Rename podspec to match package naming convention`
- **Local vs Remote**: Up to date (pushed successfully)
- **Working tree**: Clean (no uncommitted changes)

### Files Committed ✅
- ✅ Podspec rename tracked in git
- ✅ Package version bump (0.1.1)
- ✅ App package.json updated
- ✅ pnpm-lock.yaml updated

---

## 🎯 EAS Build Configuration

### Build Hooks ✅
- **PostClone hook**: `.eas/hooks/postClone.sh` (committed)
- **Purpose**: Clones Stockfish git submodule
- **Shebang**: `#!/usr/bin/env bash` ✅
- **Command**: `git submodule update --init --recursive` ✅

### Expected Build Flow ✅
1. Clone repo from GitHub
2. Run postClone.sh → Clone Stockfish submodule
3. pnpm install → Download `@uzigogetta/react-native-stockfish-jsi@0.1.1` from npm
4. expo prebuild → Generate iOS/Android folders
5. **Autolinking discovers**: `node_modules/@uzigogetta/react-native-stockfish-jsi/ios/react-native-stockfish-jsi.podspec`
6. pod install → **"Installing react-native-stockfish-jsi"** ✅
7. Compile Stockfish C++ → 15-20 minutes
8. Success!

## ⚠️ Changes From Previous Builds

### Fixed Issues:
1. ❌ **Old**: Podspec named `StockfishJSI.podspec` (autolinking couldn't find it)
   ✅ **New**: Podspec named `react-native-stockfish-jsi.podspec` (matches convention)

2. ❌ **Old**: `s.name = "StockfishJSI"` (didn't match filename)
   ✅ **New**: `s.name = "react-native-stockfish-jsi"` (matches!)

3. ❌ **Old**: Workspace package (autolinking can't discover)
   ✅ **New**: Real npm package (in node_modules/@uzigogetta/)

4. ❌ **Old**: Version 0.1.0 (had wrong naming)
   ✅ **New**: Version 0.1.1 (correct naming)

## 🔍 What to Look For in Build Logs

### Success Indicators:
```
✅ Running postClone hook
✅ Cloning into 'packages/react-native-stockfish-jsi/cpp/stockfish'...
✅ + @uzigogetta/react-native-stockfish-jsi 0.1.1
✅ Found 13 modules (or more)
✅ Installing react-native-stockfish-jsi  ← THE KEY LINE!
✅ Downloading dependencies
✅ Compiling Stockfish sources...
✅ Build time: 15-20 minutes
```

### Failure Indicators (If These Appear, Stop Build):
```
❌ Found 12 modules (same as before)
❌ NO "Installing react-native-stockfish-jsi" in pod output
❌ Build completes in < 10 minutes
```

## ✅ FINAL CHECKLIST - ALL PASSED

- [x] Package published to npm (0.1.1)
- [x] Podspec renamed to match convention
- [x] Podspec s.name matches filename
- [x] App using published version (not workspace)
- [x] Lock file shows npm registry source
- [x] All files present in node_modules
- [x] Stockfish sources present (129.9 MB unpacked)
- [x] NNUE file present (61.5 MB)
- [x] Git clean and pushed
- [x] PostClone hook ready
- [x] No custom Podfile (let expo prebuild handle it)

## 🚀 READY TO BUILD

**All systems are GO!** ✅

This is the PROPER setup that matches how all React Native native modules work (react-native-mmkv, react-native-skia, etc.).

**Command to run:**
```bash
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

**Expected outcome:** StockfishJSI will compile during pod install (15-20 min build)
